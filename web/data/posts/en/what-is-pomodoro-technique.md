Time tracking is so important

Time management is one of the most important issues. As a result, many techniques have been developed on this subject. One of the techniques used by millions of people is the pomodoro technique. The Pomodoro technique is a technique that consists of repeating 25 minutes of working time + 5 minutes of break time in periods.

The Pomodoro technique is a time management technique developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s to manage time efficiently. Because Francesco Cirillo uses this technique he developed with a tomato-like kitchen clock, this technique is called pomodoro, which means 'tomato' in Italian.
